/* Output
Experiment 1: test the aircraft engine
Aircraft engine takeoff
The aircraft engine is fine, flying at 200metres

Experiment 2: Use the engine in the SeaBird
Seacraft engine increases revs to 10 knots
Seacraft engine increases revs to 20 knots
Seacraft engine increases revs to 30 knots
Seacraft engine increases revs to 40 knots
Seacraft engine increases revs to 50 knots
The SeaBird took off

Experiment 3: Increase the speed of the Seabird:
Seacraft engine increases revs to 60 knots
Seacraft engine increases revs to 70 knots
Seabird flying at height 300 metres and speed 70 knots
Experiments successful; the Seabird flies!
